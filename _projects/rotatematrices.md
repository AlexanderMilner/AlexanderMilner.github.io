This project is based on [this write-up](assets/pdf/Unlocking_Matrices.pdf) of the final chapter of my [masters dissertation](assets/pdf/PM.pdf).

Okay its time to do some maths:

**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**\
$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$
and
$$f(x_1)=x_1^3+\sqrt{2+x_1} \in \mathbb{Q}[x_1]$$

\begin{equation}
S=x^2+\frac{x}{y} \in \mathbb{Z}(x,y)
\end{equation}
