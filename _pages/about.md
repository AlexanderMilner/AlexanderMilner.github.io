I started my PhD at the University of Edinburgh in September 2024 under the supervision of [Dr Dimitra Kosta](https://sites.google.com/view/dkosta) having graduated from my Masters in Mathematics in June 2024 from Durham University. I am funded by a School of Mathematics Studentship in the Algebra and Number Theory Research Group until 2028.

During my time at Durham I completed a research project funded by the London Mathematical Society Research Bursary supervised by [Dr Jack Shotton](https://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/users/jack.g.shotton/) into [invariant factors of elliptic curves](/assets/pdf/curves.pdf) as well as writing my masters thesis on the [Polynomial Method in Combinatorics](/assets/pdf/PM.pdf) under the supervision of [Dr Dan Evans](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/daniel-evans/).

I have recently finished writing a [Macaulay2](https://macaulay2.com/) package with [Ollie Clarke](https://sites.google.com/view/oclarke-homepage/) to compute every minimal Markov basis associated with a given configuration matrix, with the [write-up](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19031) now on the arXiv. My current research is in computational algebraic geometry, focussing on distance-reducing Markov bases.

I spend most of my spare time either playing in orchestras or conducting them and I currently hold the position of conductor of the Edinburgh University Sinfonia. Whilst at Durham, I conducted the Durham University Symphony Orchestra from September 2021 until June 2024 as well the Durham Choral Society, the Durham Opera Ensemble and the Durham Light Opera Group.

My government name is Alex(ander) but my nickname is Monty and I am happy to be called either!
