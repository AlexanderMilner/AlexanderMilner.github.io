I started my PhD at the University of Edinburgh in September 2024 under the supervision of [Dr Dimitra Kosta](https://sites.google.com/view/dkosta) having graduated from my Masters in Mathematics in June 2024 from Durham University. I am funded by a School of Mathematics Studentship in the Algebra and Number Theory Research Group until 2028.

During my time at Durham I completed a research project funded by the London Mathematical Society Research Bursary supervised by [Dr Jack Shotton](https://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/users/jack.g.shotton/) into invariant factors of elliptic curves as well as writing my masters thesis on the Polynomial Method in Combinatorics under the supervision of [Dr Dan Evans](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/daniel-evans/).

My current research is focussing on computational and applied algebraic geometry, in particular, toric geometry and matroidal structures. I am currently writing a [Macaulay2](https://macaulay2.com/) package with [Ollie Clarke](https://sites.google.com/view/oclarke-homepage/) to compute every minimal Markov basis associated with a given configuration matrix.

I spend most of my spare time either playing in orchestras or conducting them and I currently hold the position of conductor of the Edinburgh University Sinfonia.
