I am funded by a School of Mathematics Studentship in the Algebra and Number Theory Research Group until 2028.</p> <p>During my time at Durham I completed a research project funded by the London Mathematical Society Research Bursary supervised by <a href="https://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/users/jack.g.shotton/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr Jack Shotton</a> into invariant factors of elliptic curves as well as writing my masters thesis on the Polynomial Method in Combinatorics under the supervision of <a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/daniel-evans/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr Dan Evans</a>.</p> <p>My current research is focussing on computational and applied algebraic geometry, in particular, toric geometry and matroidal structures. I am currently writing a <a href="https://macaulay2.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Macaulay2</a> package with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/oclarke-homepage/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ollie Clarke</a> to compute every minimal Markov basis associated with a given configuration matrix.</p> <p>I spend most of my spare time either playing in orchestras or conducting them and I currently hold the position of conductor of the Edinburgh University Sinfonia.</p> </body></html>
